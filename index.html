                <h3>Seaweeds are important in the traditional diet of the local people of Tawi-Tawi.
                    Public markets in Tawi-Tawi constitute strong seaweed entrepreneurship virtually 
                    participated in by local women. Dubbed as the “food basket of Tawi-Tawi” (Mercado 2008),
                    the public concourse of seaweed traders and possible buyers in Batu-Batu was found significantly
                    larger (i.e., a larger difference in terms of the number of respondents) than that of Bongao.
                    Although the majority of local seaweed occupations involve domestication of eucheumatoids,
                    the local people of Tawi-Tawi also gather substantial amounts of wild seaweeds for trade.
                    Here, on the basis of morphology, seven species were identified.It appears that the number of
                    seaweed ethnotaxa else where in the Philippines, particularly the northern region of the country
                    (Dumilag 2018), is higher than what is so far known in Tawi-Tawi. Probably, such a list for Tawi-Tawi
                    will be increased once the research is conducted involving non-trade taxa
                    (i.e., those that are gathered exclusive for food sustenance and other commercial purposes)
                    at wider sampling site coverage.
